# Coconut.JS

Coconut.JS is a javascript MVVM framework insired by Vue.JS and Angular.js. You might wonder why do i need another MVVM framework when there already MVVM frameworks are available out there. So the reason why Coconut.JS came out is because most of those frameworks restrict the developer to follow their syntaxes and guidlines to write applications. Coconut.JS allows the javascript developer to use Vanilla Javascript to write MVVM applications.
